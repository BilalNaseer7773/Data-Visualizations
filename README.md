# Data-Visualizations
The repository houses a collection of data visualizations generated within Jupyter Notebooks, leveraging a variety of Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These visualizations are crafted using data sourced from multiple files, each offering unique insights into different aspects of the data. <br>



The primary objective of this repository is to explore and communicate insights derived from various datasets through visually compelling representations. By utilizing Jupyter Notebooks, it provides an interactive and iterative environment for data exploration and visualization creation. <br>


## Temperature
The visualization below shows the the average global temperature changes over the past 140 years (the Land-Ocean Temperature Index).

### Data
The temps.csv data set comes from NASA and contains the average global temperature changes over the past 140 years (the Land-Ocean Temperature Index). It contains the average temperature deviation from the 1951-1980 baseline on a month-by-month basis.

## Squarify
Below are the visualizations for the departments in the brand Bed,Bath and Beyond. The visualizations below shows how we can display the departments with different levels of details. 

### Data
This data  bbb.csv contains information about products sold at the (now bankrupt) retail chain Bed, Bath & Beyond. Each top level category is broken down into several un-named items, each with some value that represents the number links on the BBB website associated with that sub-category. <br>
