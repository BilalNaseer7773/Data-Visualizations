# Data-Visualizations
The repository houses a collection of data visualizations generated within Jupyter Notebooks, leveraging a variety of Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. These visualizations are crafted using data sourced from multiple files, each offering unique insights into different aspects of the data. <br>



The primary objective of this repository is to explore and communicate insights derived from various datasets through visually compelling representations. By utilizing Jupyter Notebooks, it provides an interactive and iterative environment for data exploration and visualization creation. <br>


## Temperature
The visualization below shows the the average global temperature changes over the past 140 years (the Land-Ocean Temperature Index).

### Data
The temps.csv data set comes from NASA and contains the average global temperature changes over the past 140 years (the Land-Ocean Temperature Index). It contains the average temperature deviation from the 1951-1980 baseline on a month-by-month basis.

## Squarify
Below are the visualizations for the departments in the brand Bed,Bath and Beyond. The visualizations below shows how we can display the departments with different levels of details. 

### Data
This data  bbb.csv contains information about products sold at the (now bankrupt) retail chain Bed, Bath & Beyond. Each top level category is broken down into several un-named items, each with some value that represents the number links on the BBB website associated with that sub-category. <br>

## Sleep
Below are the visualizations for daily number of hours of sleep that are recommended, appropriate, and not recommended by various age groups. This data was compiled by the National Sleep Foundation in the USA from a panel comprised of members and sleep experts from various American medical associations. <br>

### Data
The analysis utilizes the following datasets: <br>
sleep.csv: Contains information for the recommended sleeping hours for different age group and how they vary. <br>

## Plastic
Below are the visualizations related to plastic production and its impact on the environment. <br>

### Data
The analysis utilizes the following datasets: <br>
plastic-production.csv: Contains information on plastic production by year and sector. <br>
river-plastics.csv: Provides data on the impact of a country's coastal length, area, and rainfall on its percentage of plastic waste emitted into the oceans. <br>

## Birth Data Visualization<br>
The visualization below shows the babies born per minute in the USA in the year 2022.<br>

## IPY widgets <br>
The following heatmap shows the average carat weight of diamonds relative to their clarity and colour. An interactive dropdown menu allows for the data to be filtered around the origin of the diamonds. The “Natural” option filters to only naturally occurring diamonds, “Lab” filters to manufactured diamonds, and “All’ applies no filtering. In the example below, we can see that the heaviest diamonds are those with the poorest quality. <br>

The interactive visualization below shows the height and weight distributions for gold-medal winning athletes in the 2000 to 2016 Olympics (inclusive). The default view is a heat map where the data has been binned in value increments of 5, that is, 20 to 25, 25 to 30, 30 to 35, etc. (Hint: Seaborn’s heatmap is the hard way to do this. What else can bin data?)
The dropdown menu filters the athletes to a specific sport category. The options are Swimming, Wrestling, Fencing, Athletics, Shooting, Cycling, Rowing, and Gymnastics, plus a “Combined” option that is the combination of athletes from all of those sports. The “kde” checkbox will change the visualization to a contour plot of the distribution estimated using kernel density estimation, as shown below.<br>
